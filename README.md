# FitCheck
Hey everyone! You chose to read about my FitCheck repo! Below are some details if you would like to know more about the development process:

## Why did I make this?:
This project was made to get my hands wet in Machine Learning models/algos, specifically Logistic Regression for this repo,and understand the various ways of interacting with data such as pandas, numpy, sklearn, etc. As well, it 

## Technologies/Languages Used:
- Python
- HTML
- Jupyter Notebook
- Flask

## Problems/Challenges Faced and What I Learned:
Although a fun project, there were a ton of learning curves. Firstly, implementing the model itself took some time to understand as ML is very math heavy. On top of that, integrating the model into Flask to be used took some reading upon to see where I can implement it, and hook it up to a front end. 

## What's next?:
There is still a long way to go. I would love to incorporate a clean, stylistic frontend, and add a lot more functionality to the API. It currently is in its MVP phase, so a lot can be done here.
